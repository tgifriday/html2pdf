A relative length has the form "i*", where "i" is an integer. When allotting space among elements competing for that space, user agents allot pixel and percentage lengths first, then divide up remaining available space among relative lengths. Each relative length receives a portion of the available space that is proportional to the integer preceding the "*". The value "*" is equivalent to "1*". Thus, if 60 pixels of space are available after the user agent allots pixel and percentage space, and the competing relative lengths are 1*, 2*, and 3*, the 1* will be alloted 10 pixels, the 2* will be alloted 20 pixels, and the 3* will be alloted 30 pixels.Length values are case-neutral.</div><div class="tests none">Tests: <strong>None</strong></div></div><div class="assertion must"><h3>Assertion 6.7-1</h3><div class="section">Reference: <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/types.html#h-6.7">Section 6.7</a></div><div class="description">(must)Content types are case-insensitive.

White space characters are not permitted within link types.These link types are case-insensitive.User agents, search engines, etc. may interpret these link types in a variety of ways.Alternate: Designates substitute versions for the document in which the link occurs. When used together with the lang attribute, it implies a translated version of the document. When used together with the media attribute, it implies a version designed for a different medium (or media).Stylesheet: Refers to an external style sheet. See the section on external style sheets for details. This is used together with the link type "Alternate" for user-selectable alternate style sheets.Start: Refers to the first document in a collection of documents. This link type tells search engines which document is considered by the author to be the starting point of the collection.Next: Refers to the next document in a linear sequence of documents. User agents may choose to preload the "next" document, to reduce the perceived load time.Prev:Refers to the previous document in an ordered series of documents. Some user agents also support the synonym "Previous".Contents:Refers to a document serving as a table of contents. Some user agents also support the synonym ToC (from "Table of Contents").Index: Refers to a document providing an index for the current document.Glossary: Refers to a document providing a glossary of terms that pertain to the current document.Copyright: Refers to a copyright statement for the current document.Chapter: Refers to a document serving as a chapter in a collection of documents.Section: Refers to a document serving as a section in a collection of documents.Subsection: Refers to a document serving as a subsection in a collection of documents.Appendix: Refers to a document serving as an appendix in a collection of documents.Help: Refers to a document offering help (more information, links to other sources information, etc.)Bookmark: Refers to a bookmark. A bookmark is a link to a key entry point within an extended document. The title attribute may be used, for example, to label the bookmark. Note that several bookmarks may be defined in each document.</div><div class="tests none">Tests: <strong>None</strong></div></div><div class="assertion informative"><h3>Assertion 6.13-1</h3><div class="section">Reference: <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/types.html#h-6.13">Section 6.13</a></div><div class="description">(informative)The following is a list of recognized media descriptors ( %MediaDesc in the DTD).screen: Intended for non-paged computer screens.tty: Intended for media using a fixed-pitch character grid, such as teletypes, terminals, or portable devices with limited display capabilities.tv: Intended for television-type devices (low resolution, color, limited scrollability).projection: Intended for projectors.handheld: Intended for handheld devices (small screen, monochrome, bitmapped graphics, limited bandwidth).print: Intended for paged, opaque material and for documents viewed on screen in print preview mode.braille: Intended for braille tactile feedback devices.aural: Intended for speech synthesizers.all: Suitable for all devices.</div><div class="tests none">Tests: <strong>None</strong></div></div><div class="assertion must"><h3>Assertion 6.13-2</h3><div class="section">Reference: <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/types.html#h-6.13">Section 6.13</a></div><div class="description">(must)conforming user agents must be able to parse the media attribute value as follows:1.
