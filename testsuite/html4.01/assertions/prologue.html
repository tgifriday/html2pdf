<h1>HTML 4.01 Test Suite - Assertions</h1>

<h2>Testable Assertions Prologue</h2>
<div class="navigation">
<hr>
[<a href="assertions_toc.html">Previous</a>] [<a href="assertions_section05.html">Next</a>] [<a href="assertions_toc.html">Contents</a>] [<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/">Specification</a>]
<hr>
</div>

<p>The testable assertions from the HTML specification are grouped by section, with one page per section. Each testable assertion consists of the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>A heading with the assertion number, e.g. &quot;Assertion 5.1-1&quot;</li>
	<li>A hyperlinked reference to the specific section.</li>
	<li>The text of the assertion itself, prepended with one or more of the following
	<ul>
		<li>(author) - indicates that this assertion is a requirement for content authors</li>
		<li>(must) - indicates that this assertion is a required feature of the specification</li>
		<li>(should) - indicates that this assertion is an optional but strongly encouraged feature of the specification</li>
		<li>(may) - indicates that this assertion is an optional feature of the specification</li>
		<li>(informative) - indicates that this assertion refers to only an informative aspect of the specification</li>
		<li>(deprecated) - indicates that this feature is deprecated</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>A series of hyperlinks to test cases which test that assertion</li>
</ul>

<p>In some places the specification does not use must/should/may wording explicitly, but does use comparable wording which we treated according to the following transform:</p>
<ol>
	<li>are | requires | causes | does --&gt; must</li>
	<li>can --&gt; should</li>
	<li>hint --&gt; may</li>
</ol>

<p>
There are navigation links at the top of each assertion page that look like the following: 
</p>

<p>
[<span class="fakeanchor">Previous</span>] [<span class="fakeanchor">Next</span>] [<span class="fakeanchor">Contents</span>] [<span class="fakeanchor">Specification</span>]
</p>

<p>
The four links are, respectively:
</p>
<ul>
<li>[<span class="fakeanchor">Previous</span>] and [<span class="fakeanchor">Next</span>] will take you to the previous or next assertion page, respectively.  These allow you to move through the entire assertion list a section at a time, going directly from section to section.</li>
<li>[<span class="fakeanchor">Contents</span>] will take you to the table of contents.</li>
<li>[<span class="fakeanchor">Specification</span>] will take you to the relevant section of the HTML4 specification.</li>
</ul>

<p>A typical assertion looks like this:</p>

<div class="assertion must"><h3>Assertion 15.3-11</h3><div class="section">Reference: <span class="two">Section 15.3</span></div>
<div class="description">(must) The HR element causes a horizontal rule to be rendered by visual user agents.</div>
<div class="tests">Tests: <span class="three">15_3-BF-01.html</span></div></div>

<p>The name of this assertion is <span class="one">Assertion 15.3-11</span>. It references <span class="two">Section 15.3</span> of the HTML specification. Because of the presence of &quot;(must)&quot; this assertion is a required feature of the specification. It has one test, <span class="three">15_3-BF-01.html</span>. The links to tests have a <span class="three">light green background</span> for easier identification. Note that some assertions currently do not have any tests written for them.</p>
